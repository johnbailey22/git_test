    <h1>5 Steps to Building Your Brand.</h1>
    <h4>Leave a Comment | tags: branding | written by <a href="https://3sillustrative.com">3S Illustrative</a></h4>
    <br>
    <p>What is a Brand? Well if you Google the term, you’ll probably 
      come across a meaning which states <em>“A brand is an overall 
      experience of a business that distinguishes it from its 
      competitors in the eyes of the customer.”</em> Which is true, but a 
      shorter way of saying that basically is <strong>”A brand is what your 
      customer feels and think about you, your business, your product 
      and/or services.”</strong> Basically, your brand is you.</p>

    <p>How you come across to your target audience, what they think of 
      your products or services, how they feel when they hear your name, 
      see your logo and even how they react when someone else reacts to 
      you. In short, your brand is every aspect of your business (as it 
      relates to the wide public and your audience).</p>

    <p>With this in mind any business would do well to develop a brand 
      in which is most appealing to it’s consumers. They’ll cater to 
      their fans, add value to the lives of their customers, be on their 
      P’s and Q’s whenever operating in an official sense, giving 
      confidence and trust to those most in their corner. To a business, 
      branding and brand development is the cornerstone to great 
      business and longevity in the marketplace. 
      That is why we at 3S Illustrative also find it imperative to focus 
      on a business’ brand development when working with clients. 
      As a business there are many things to consider when developing 
      an identity and we intend to explore those ideas in this series. 
      They are as follows:</p>
<br>
<h2>Determining Your Target Market</h2>
      <p>We would all like to think that the service or product we 
        provide is so great that anyone and everyone would be dying to 
        use it, that it can be seen as valuable to any person’s life 
        and day to day going-ons. Whether it be a faster, easier way of 
        getting chores done around the house, or a productivity tool 
        which helps you study more, or even an app which provides you 
        with free content catered to your likes and needs. Whatever it 
        may be there is a high enough chance that not everyone is going 
        to be inclined to like it. This doesn’t mean what you’re 
        offering is bad, it just means that you have to find the right 
        people who will love it. Targeting a specific audience who sees 
        the value in the work you do is paramount to any brand 
        development and identity. It helps you foster a better 
        relationship with your clients and customers and allows for a 
        uniquely tailored experience. If your company makes gourmet 
        custom pastries you wouldn’t expect diabetics person to be your 
        main client, would you? No. Which is why it is best to know 
        your customer and develop an experience and identity which will 
        most suit them.</p>
<br>
<h2>Define Your Mission & Vision</h2>
        <p>After knowing who you’re selling to, perhaps knowing what 
          and why you’re selling is the most important aspect of a 
          Brand’s Identity. This can be a hard thing to consider, as 
          most companies starting up have little to no idea as to what 
          this may entail. The simplest way I think of defining this 
          would be:</p>

        <p><strong>A Mission Statement is a company’s objectives, overall business and 
          standards;</strong></p>
        <p><strong>A Vision Statement is a company’s future goals and 
          objectives which it intends to achieve.</strong></p>

        <p>In developing these statements, there are a few questions one needs 
          to ask, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>What Does Your Company Do?</em></li>
<li><em>What problems Do Your Company Solve?</em></li>
<li><em>What Makes Your Company Different from Others?</em></li>
<li><em>Where do you see your Company in 5-10 Years?</em></li>
<li><em>What do you hope to Achieve?</em></li>
</ul>
        <p>These basic question can help in developing an identity which is 
          tailored towards a clear path and goals for your brand to work by. 
          Coupled with the target audience this step will make your brand 
          identity solid.</p>
<br>
<h2>Creating a Mark.</h2>
        <p>This step is what most people think about when brands are 
          mentioned. This is a Logo, a Letterhead, a Mascot etc. All 
          visual marks which represents a company’s image in the public 
          and to its consumer base. This is also where most brands 
          fail in the branding identity development.</p>

        <p>This step, although an important one, is not the right 
          place to start. having a Logo without having a meaning 
          (Mission) or a future path (Vision) for what it represents 
          is like having a meal of empty calories. It may taste good, 
          but it holds no value. It says nothing and it offers nothing 
          to its consumers (if it even appeals to them) as the 
          consumer base was not defined in the first place.</p>

        <p>A brand’s mark should be both representative of 
          what it stands for and cater to the liking and appeals of 
          its target audience. This helps its message and goals stay 
          consistent and clearly defined as it builds and develops 
          relationships with its fans.</p>
<br>
<h2>Quality & Consistency.</h2>
          <p>Now we’ve come to the practical stage of a brand’s lifetime,
             Quality and Consistency. This stage puts a brand’s identity 
             to the test and if not carefully handled can break all the 
             work done so far in the development cycle. It is always 
             important keep a consistent image of your brand in the 
             public space, and this is determined by the previously 
             discussed steps. From how you post online, your presence 
             on social media, your ads and marketing and just as 
             important, your products and services. This helps develop 
             your standing within the chosen culture and landscape which 
             your brand resides and makes it more relatable and engaging 
             to your core fans and followers. It also helps in garnering 
             more following and growth in your consumer base.</p>
<br>
<h2>Growth & Change.</h2>
          <p>Now may come the hard part, and this may seem contrary to 
            the previous points made… but a brand must be willing to, 
            or capable of Growth & Change. Now you may not want to 
            consider this as in the same line of re-branding, instead it 
            is allowing your brand the ability to adapt to the change in 
            the current climate of it’s culture, while still remaining 
            true to it’s core ideals and beliefs. Therefore the brand 
            and it’s messaging may stay the same, but the method(s) in 
            which they are shared and brought to it’s fan-base develops 
            and change to fit better along it’s lifetime and journey. 
            Most of the biggest and best brands do this, whether it be 
            pop culture brands that showcases trends in the wider 
            community (think Fashion & Media), or well-established older 
            brands that updates it’s style (while still retaining it’s 
            iconic appeal) to appeal to a modern audience (think 
            Technology and Artists). The best quality of a good brand is 
            that it is adaptable and applicable in multiple ways, while 
            still being able to remain iconic. if your brand can’t last
             a decade, it most likely won’t last a year.</p>
<br>
    <p>And that’s about covers it. These five basic steps are what we 
    believe should be considered when developing a brand identity for any 
    business or personal brand. There are more in depth looks at what can
    make a brand great and we intend to explore and expand on these ideas 
    as we continue this journey in brand development with you.</p>
